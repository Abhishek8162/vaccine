        Vaccinations protect not only you but also others. If we continue vaccination,
         there is a possibility that  
         the pandemic would get controlled significantly and it will also protect the future population.
        
        All the vaccines today are safe and its  a very rare case
         where a vaccine would have a side effect. The chances of protecting you
        from Covid-19 are much higher than that of a side effect.
